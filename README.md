# Data-structures-algorithms
This repo will contain most of the Data structures and algorithms implemented.

## Steps to run the program:
1- Download all source files <br>
2- To compile multiple cpp files you can type on the terminal while being on the same directory :
   ```
    g++ main.cpp DSA.cpp -o output.exe

   ```
then run the program by typing:
```
./output.exe

```
or you can create a tasks.json file on vscode<br>

Here in the args field you can remove the third line and put:
```
"${workspaceFolder}/*.cpp",

```
this command tells the compiler to compile all the files with the cpp extension
